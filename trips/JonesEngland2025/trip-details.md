## Styling and document creation guide:

- Use a compact, information dense layout to fit on fewer pages
- Add links to reliable internet information for all sites where available for mobile-first documents and when requested to provide links. 
- Use day of week, trip day, and date Example: Mon Oct 6 (Day 1)
- When creating full trip overview check location guides to ensure dates are correct
- Use aiport names and codes for flights, show layover time and eastern US time for arrival at destination for long distance trips. 
- Do not print hotel prices or viator excursions (they are part of the package price)
- Show price range or $$ scale for dining and non-viator admission when known. 
- Omit colored background for pricing for readability
- Additional dining or quirky / frugal shopping suggestions are good for filling empty space. 
- Use Day, date (day of trip #) and descriptive titles for each day
