# Critical Development Rules for AI (directives)
**Do not break these rules.**

## Core Principles
- Do not replace existing directives without explicit instruction
- Do not update arbitrary files without user consent
- Ensure backend and frontend work remain in sync
- Only update ai_docs when explicitly directed or for progress tracking
- Do not remove comments or break existing functionality
- Always maintain code quality and documentation standards

## Documentation Guidelines
- Keep feature files up-to-date in appropriate directories
- Document all significant changes in changelog
- Update technical documentation when modifying architecture
- Maintain clear and concise commit messages

## Code Management
- Follow established commit message conventions
- Ensure all new features have corresponding documentation
- Keep feature progress tracked in both files and memories
- Validate changes against existing functionality

## Security and Safety
- Never expose sensitive information in code or comments
- Keep API keys and credentials in appropriate env files
- Follow security best practices in code implementation

## Feature Development
- Create detailed specifications before implementation
- Track progress systematically
- Update documentation throughout development
- Move completed features to features_done directory

**Remember: These rules are fundamental to maintaining code quality and project organization. Do not break them.**
