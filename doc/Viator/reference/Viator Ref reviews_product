/reviews/product

Retrieves and filters reviews for a single product Reviews should be cached and refreshed weekly, as well as on-demand when you see that the product content endpoint returns a different review count than saved in your database for the product.

Non-indexing of reviews

    Review content is protected proprietary information; therefore, you may not allow review content to be indexed by search engines. In order for your site to be certified, you will need to demonstrate that you have implemented systems to ensure that review content is non-indexed. For more information, see Key concepts - Protecting unique content.

Availability of reviews

    Occasionally, reviews are deleted due to inauthenticity, offensive language, etc. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that non-Viator reviews (i.e., those for which the provider is not "VIATOR") will remain available in future (however, you will receive a notification email to inform you should this occurr). As such, we require that you implement a mechanism by which locally-cached reviews are automatically deleted from your records (and are not displayed on your site) if they do not appear in the most recent response from this endpoint.
