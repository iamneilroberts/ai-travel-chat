locations/bulk

Get full location details for the requested location references. Locations should be cached and refreshed monthly. Additionally, the /locations/bulk endpoint should be used on demand for any new location references returned in the product content response.

Note: If no response is received for a given location reference, this means that the location was either removed from our database or replaced by a different one. If this occurs, please disregard the removed location reference and make sure you update the associated product information.
