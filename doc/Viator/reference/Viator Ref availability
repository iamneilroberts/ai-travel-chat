Availability
/availability/check

Check real-time availability and pricing for a product depending on the date, pax-mix, start time and/or product option.

We recommend using the pricing information returned by this endpoint as the source of truth for the amount you will be invoiced by Viator for the sale of the product in question.

The third response example – 265910P1 (commission payment model) – shows the alternative PriceObject for merchants using the commission payment model.

Note: This service should only be used to determine the availability of a product immediately prior to booking. Bulk operations pertaining to product availability; e.g., generating a calendar of availability for a product, should use the availability schedule endpoints.

/availability/schedules/modified-since

Get full future availability details for all products modified since the specified time. The pricing is returned in the supplier's currency. We recommend using the /exchange-rates endpoint to get the Viator exchange rates and apply them for pricing conversion. Initiate a full ingestion only to establish your local copy; this should be a rare occurrence compared to regular updates. Fetch incremental updates through this endpoint on an hourly basis. You are welcome to poll for updates as frequently as every 15 minutes if desired. Be mindful that excessive frequency beyond these recommendations may trigger rate limits.

query Parameters
cursor	
string

Pagination cursor received from a previous call to this endpoint that points to the desired starting point for the results.

Note: Pagination will come into play when the number of results exceeds the figure given in the count parameter. In this case, pass the content of the nextCursor element for the value of cursor to receive the next page of results. The final page of results will not include the nextCursor element. For more information, see: Ingesting and updating availability schedules.

    Example: 'MTYwNTA2ODAwOXw1NjcyUDk='

count	
integer [ 1 .. 500 ]

The maximum number of products to be returned in response.

    Maximum allowed and default value: 500

modified-since	
string <date-time> ^(-?(?:[1-9][0-9]*)?[0-9]{4})-(1[0-2]|0[1-9])...

Only retrieve availabilty schedules that have been modified since the date and time (UTC) specified by this timestamp

Note:

    As this is a query parameter, colons (i.e., :) in the timestamp should be URL-encoded as %3A; e.g.: "2020-09-30T00%3A00%3A01.737043Z"
    Using this parameter is not recommended as the standard pagination method; rather, use the cursor parameter to ensure all availability schedule updates are captured during ingestion.
