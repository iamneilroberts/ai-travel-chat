Product content endpoints

You can retrieve the core product-content details from the following endpoints:

    /products/{product-code}: Retrieve content for a single product in real time when the product is selected by the customer
        Used by: API partners who do not ingest the product database, but instead get each product's details only when required
    /products/modified-since: Retrieve content for all products with filtering according to modification date
        Used by: API partners who ingest the entire product catalog into a local database and perform regular delta updates via this endpoint to keep their local data in-sync with Viator's
    /products/bulk: Retrieve content for multiple products, as specified in the request.
        Please note: This endpoint must not be used for ingestion; rather, it should only be used to retrieve product details for the selected products when needed.

        Used by: API partners who ingest all availability schedules into a local database and perform regular delta updates via this endpoint to keep their local data in-sync with Viator's
